# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to the 100 Days of Python challenge! This repository is designed to guide you through 100 days of learning and practicing Python programming. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to enhance your Python skills, this challenge is perfect for you.

## Overview

This challenge is divided into 100 days, each with its own set of tasks and exercises. The goal is to spend at least an hour each day working on Python-related activities, such as coding exercises, projects, or studying Python concepts.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will allow you to track your progress and make updates as you complete each day.

2. **Clone the repository**: Once you've forked the repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/100-days-of-python.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the day's folder**: Each day has its own folder (e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.). Navigate to the folder corresponding to the current day.

4. **Read the README file**: Each day's folder contains a README file with instructions and tasks for that day. Read the README file carefully before starting the day's activities.

5. **Complete the tasks**: Spend at least an hour working on the tasks and exercises for the day. If you finish early, feel free to explore additional Python topics or work on personal projects.

6. **Update your progress**: After completing the day's activities, update the README file in your forked repository to reflect your progress. You can use the provided template or create your own format.
