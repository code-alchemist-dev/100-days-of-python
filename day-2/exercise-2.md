# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

## Description

This program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height inputs. BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight and height.

The BMI is calculated using the formula:

## $\ BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2}$

where:

- weight is the person's weight in kilograms (kg).

- height is the person's height in meters (m).

**Note**: Ensure that the program can accept and process inputs for weight and height.

## Input

```python
input_weight = 60  # Weight in kilograms
input_height = 2   # Height in meters
```

## Output

The BMI is calculated as follows:

\[ BMI = \frac{60}{2 \times 2} = 15 \]

```python
result = 15
```

The output displays the calculated BMI value.
