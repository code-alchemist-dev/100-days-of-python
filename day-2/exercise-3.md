# Life Calculator

## Objective

The objective of this program is to calculate the remaining time in terms of days,
weeks, and months until a person reaches the age of 90 years old.

## Instructions

To accomplish this task, use f-strings in your Python program. The program should
 take a person's current age in years as input and output the remaining time in the following format:

*You x days, y weeks, and z months left to live.*

## Input

The input to the program will be the person's current age in years.

```python
input: 20
```

## Output

For example, if the person's current age is 20 years, the output would be:

```python
result: You have 10 days, 2 weeks, and 11 months left to live.
```

This indicates that the person has 10 days, 2 weeks, and 11 months remaining until they reach 90 years of age.
