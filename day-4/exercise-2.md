# Program Instructions

## Objective

You are tasked with writing a program that will randomly select an individual from a provided list of names. The selected individual will be responsible for paying the food bill for everyone.

**Important:** Usage of the `choice()` function is prohibited.

## Details

On line 8, the program splits the `names_string` into individual names and stores them in a list called `names`. For this to function correctly, ensure all names are entered in the following format: `name, name, name`.

## Example Input

```plaintext
Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eva
```

**Note:** Ensure there is a space following each comma before the next name.

## Example Output

```plaintext
David is going to buy the meal today!
```

## Hint

The `len()` function may be necessary for your implementation.

Remember, list indices start at 0!
