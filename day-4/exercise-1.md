# Instructions

In this task, you will develop a virtual coin toss program. The program will randomly inform the user whether the result is "Heads" or "Tails".

It is crucial that the first letter is capitalized and the spelling matches exactly as shown in the examples: "Heads" and not "heads."

There are several methods to achieve this. However, to practice the concepts learned in the previous lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then, use that number to display either "Heads" or "Tails."

For example:

- 1 means "Heads"
- 0 means "Tails"

## Example Output

```python
Heads
```

or

```python
Tails
```
