# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Instructions

   "What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors."

2. **User Input**:

3. **Computer Choice**:
   - Devise a method to generate a random choice for the computer.

4. **Comparison and Outcome**:
   - Compare the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the outcome: win, lose, or draw.

5. **Feedback**:
   - Provide feedback to the player based on the comparison result.
