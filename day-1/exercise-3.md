# Character Counter Program

## Overview

This program takes a user name as input and prints out the number of characters in the name.

## Program Logic

1. Prompt the user to enter their name.
2. Read the input from the user.
3. Calculate the number of characters in the input.
4. Print out the number of characters.

## Example

```python
Please enter your name: John
4
```

## Notes

- The program is case-sensitive, so it will count upper and lower case letters separately.
- Leading and trailing spaces in the input name will also be counted as characters.
