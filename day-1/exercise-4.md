# Variable Switcher

## Overview

This program is designed to switch the values stored in two variables, `a` and `b`.

## Functionality

The program takes the values stored in variables `a` and `b`, swaps their values, and assigns the new values to the variables. This process effectively exchanges the values stored in `a` and `b`.

## Algorithm

1. Store the initial value of variable `a` in a temporary variable.
2. Assign the value of variable `b` to variable `a`.
3. Assign the value stored in the temporary variable (initial value of `a`) to variable `b`.

## Usage

1. Replace `<initial value of a>` and `<initial value of b>` with the desired initial values for variables `a` and `b`.
2. Execute the program to see the values of `a` and `b` swapped.

## Example

Suppose `a` initially holds the value `5` and `b` holds the value `10`. After executing the program, `a` will hold `10` and `b` will hold `5`, effectively swapping their values.
